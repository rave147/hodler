# HODLWAY

The HODLWAY project is a set of smart contracts in the solidity language, which is designed to create hodl smart contracts that store money and return it only after certain conditions are met: reaching a certain crypto-currency value or changing the inflation rate.

Data on ETH/USD and Polygon(MATIÐ¡)/USD pairs are taken through decentralized [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) oracles. Information about inflation is taken from the [Truflashion](https://truflation.com/) service through chainlink oracles.
